erlang-slang for Debian
-----------------------


Known Problems:

- The erlang repl doesn't seem to like erlang-slang mucking around with
  the terminal much. A work around is to compile your erlang sources
  using erlc and run them using erl -noshell -s Mod Fun

- The documentation is not complete though usable.
